## How to transpile and run

Start gulp by just running `gulp` in the console. Start the code by running `dist/main.js` with Web Server for Chrome or a similar product. Anytime you save, gulp should recompile the code automatically.

Setup follows [this helpful guide from TypeScript] (https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/gulp.html) (Up through Watchify).
